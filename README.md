# Streamlit secrets.toml Vulnerability Repository

## Disclaimer

> This repository is created strictly for educational purposes, with the intention of promoting awareness about potential security vulnerabilities in Streamlit applications. Developers are strongly advised to adhere to best practices and implement necessary precautions to enhance the security of their applications. The maintainers of this repository disclaim any responsibility for misuse or unauthorized access resulting from the information provided herein. Responsible disclosure and collaboration with Streamlit's security team are recommended for addressing and mitigating such vulnerabilities.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to identifying and addressing a security vulnerability related to the `secrets.toml` file used in Streamlit applications. The primary goal of this project is to raise awareness about potential risks associated with data leaks that may occur when handling sensitive information within the Streamlit framework using `secrets.toml`.

## Security Vulnerability

### Description

Streamlit is a widely used Python library for creating web applications with ease. However, a critical security concern arises when users input sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, into a Streamlit web app. This repository aims to underscore the importance of secure secrets management in Streamlit applications.

#### Navigate to `main.py`

In this file, you can see that the entire Streamlit app appears condensed into just a few lines of code. This compression is achieved through the use of the built-in `exec()` function. The alarming aspect is that the true functionality of the app is obscured, making it challenging for anyone inspecting the source code to comprehend its actual operations.

The script responsible for leaking sensitive data is stored discreetly in the `secrets.toml` file, remaining entirely invisible to code reviewers. This poses a significant security risk, as the executed script imports confidential information into the main app, executed seamlessly with the help of the `exec()` function.

#### Navigate to `secrets.toml`

Now let's discuss the script present in the `secrets.toml`. A lambda function is defined to send data via triggering a bot to send the input data to a discord channel through an api post request made using requests module. Since I'm working in the `secrets.toml` itself, I can directly place the environment variables.
